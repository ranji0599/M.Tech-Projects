This file documents all the materials developed during the process of identifying a problem statement and building a prototype for a Bedsores Prevention System.

Bedsores, a condition commonly observed in bedridden and elderly patients who are admitted to hospitals for extended periods, occur when individuals are unable to change their body position without assistance. 

Prolonged pressure on one side of the body—especially near bony areas—can lead to the contraction of blood vessels, reducing blood flow and oxygen supply to the surrounding tissues. Over time, this results in tissue damage.

To prevent this, the system incorporates microvibrations and lateral bed movements, using key parameters such as pressure, temperature, and humidity for monitoring and intervention.
